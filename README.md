# TransmissionsQt

A simple QT5 QtWidget GUI based client side software aimed at creating, editing and sharing informations about patients in a hospital-ward context.
Originally developped in Java + Swing (2012-2013), ported to Qt & C++ in early 2014

*Created to fit the needs of a Geriatrics Unit in particular (Cours Séjour Gériatrique, CH Tourcoing, France) but can easily be adapted for others
*Can be extended for all types of HealthCare Units
*Uses a per-hospital-bed view both for editing and displaying useful informations
*Quite foolproof (intended users may have a poor knowledge of basic computer-oriented skills)
